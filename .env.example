# TODO: When NODE_ENV is 'test' the previous team would often set `lazyConnect` in the ioRedis connection config to
# 'true'. It's not always the case though and things seem fine?? So, see if we can go without it (less complexity) else
# try and figure out why its needed when testing (nothing so far when Googling)
# From the docs
# By default, When a new Redis instance is created, it will connect to Redis server automatically. If you want to keep
# disconnected until a command is called, you can pass the lazyConnect option to the constructor
