        This service is run by the Environment Agency. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. 
                                                                                For example, that means you should be able to:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We have also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
