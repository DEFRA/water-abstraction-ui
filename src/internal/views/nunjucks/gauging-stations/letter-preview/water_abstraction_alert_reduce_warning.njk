                <p>Dear licence contact,</p>

                <p>The {{personalisation.flow_or_level}} at {{personalisation.monitoring_station_name}} monitoring station is close to the hands-off {{personalisation.flow_or_level}} threshold for your licence {{personalisation.licence_ref}}</p>

                <p>This means you can still take water in line with the conditions of your licence.  But you may need to restrict this to the reduced amount stated in your condition soon.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What you need to do</h2>
                <p>You have a hands-off {{personalisation.flow_or_level}} condition in your licence. This limits the amount of water you can take when the hands-off {{personalisation.flow_or_level}} threshold applies.</p>

                <p>You should check the full details of your condition. This includes the reduced amount you can take when the restriction is in place.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What happens next</h2>
                <p>We'll write to you again if you need to reduce the amount of water that you take.</p>

                <p>If you do not hear from us, you can continue to take water in line with your licence.</p>

                <p>There may be other conditions that affect how much water you can take. You must meet all of your licence conditions.</p>
