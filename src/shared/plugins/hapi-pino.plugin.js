 * Return test configuration options for the logger
 *
 * When we run our unit tests we don't want the output polluted by noise from the logger. So as a default we set the
 * configuration to tell hapi-pino to ignore all events.
 *
 * But there will be times when trying to diagnose an issue that we will want log output. So using an env var we can
 * override the default and tell hapi-pino to log everything as normal.
 *
 * In both cases using the
 * {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax|spread operator} on
 * the returned value will allow it to be incorporated with our default hapi-pino options.
